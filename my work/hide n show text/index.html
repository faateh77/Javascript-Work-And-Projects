       <p id="p1">The tiger, scientifically known as Panthera tigris, is one of the most majestic and powerful wild animals in the world, often referred to as the king of the jungle. It is the largest species of wild cat, known for its muscular build, fierce nature, and its striking orange coat marked with unique black stripesâ€”no two tigers have the same stripe pattern, much like human fingerprints.Tigers are solitary hunters and are mostly active during the night. They primarily prey on animals such as deer, wild boar, and other large herbivores. Interestingly, tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in ponds, rivers, or lakes, especially during hot weather. <a href="#"  id="readmore" >Read more</a>
       <p id="p2" class="hidden">They are found across various parts of Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Russia, China, and Southeast Asia, with each region home to a different subspecies, such as the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and more. Unfortunately, tigers face serious threats due to habitat destruction, illegal hunting, and human conflict, making most subspecies endangered and in need of strong conservation efforts to ensure their survival in the wild. </p>
